üß∞ Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET Core ‚Äì Key Concepts

DI Lifetimes

Singleton: One instance for the entire application lifetime. All consumers get the same instance.

Scoped: One instance per HTTP request. Shared across services within the same request.

Transient: A new instance is created every time the service is requested.

Service Lifetime Effects

GuidService (with a generated Guid) is used to demonstrate the effect of lifetimes.

If GuidService is Transient ‚Üí every injection results in a different GUID.

If GuidService is Scoped ‚Üí all services in one request get the same GUID.

If GuidService is Singleton ‚Üí same GUID across all requests and services.

Dependency Chains

MessageService and AnotherService both depend on DateTimeService and/or GuidService.

CombinedService depends on both MessageService and AnotherService.

Even if MessageService is Scoped, if GuidService is Transient ‚Üí each dependent gets a different instance.

Key Insight

Changing the lifetime of services like MessageService or CombinedService does not affect whether their dependencies (like GuidService) are shared.
What matters is the lifetime of the dependency itself (GuidService).

Practical Behavior (Assuming Scoped GuidService)

Service Lifetime	Will Get Same GuidService Instance?
MessageService: Scoped	‚úÖ Yes (per request)
CombinedService: Scoped	‚úÖ Yes (shares context)
GuidService: Scoped	‚úÖ Yes (shared if resolved in same request)
GuidService: Transient	‚ùå No (new instance every time)

Constructor Injection Best Practice

Always prefer constructor injection over resolving services from IServiceProvider.

Makes your services testable, predictable, and avoids runtime errors.

Caching Behavior Example

DateTimeService caches DateTime.Now at construction.

Registering it as Singleton ‚Üí same timestamp forever.

Registering it as Transient ‚Üí updated every time it's used.

Registering it as Scoped ‚Üí consistent timestamp within a single request.

Middleware Integration

Custom middleware logs request start and end time.

Useful for observing behavior across scoped dependencies.


üîç Real-World Use Cases for Transient Lifetime:

1. Stateless Utility Services:
   - ValidationService, EncryptionHelper, RandomGenerator
   - Light, short-lived, and safe to create multiple times.

2. DTO Mapping:
   - Services like AutoMapper or custom DTO-to-entity mappers.
   - builder.Services.AddTransient<IMapper, CustomMapper>();

3. Formatters/Converters:
   - PdfFormatter, JsonFormatter, CsvFormatter (used once per operation).

4. Token or ID Generators:
   - ITokenGenerator generating fresh tokens every request.

5. Command Handlers (CQRS pattern):
   - builder.Services.AddTransient<ICommandHandler<CreateUserCommand>, Handler>();
   - Executed once per request.

6. Pipeline Behaviors (e.g., MediatR):
   - LoggingBehavior<T>, ValidationBehavior<T>

7. Unit Testing:
   - Transient mocks and test doubles for isolation across test methods.

üß† Summary:
Transient = new instance per resolution.
Best for: lightweight, stateless, safe-to-recreate services.
Avoid for: expensive setup, shared state, or where caching is needed.
